    "text": "Section 6.1 Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 1\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nConsider the random variable \\(X\\) where \\(X =\\) number of stars given by a randomly selected book reviewer. The probability distribution of the number of stars is shown below. Estimate the probability that a randomly selected reviewer gave a given book a three-star rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability value for three-star rating is 0.11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 2\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nWhen an unfair coin is tossed, the probability that it lands on heads is 80%, and the probability that it lands on tails is 20%. Let \\(H\\) to mean heads and \\(T\\) tails.\n\nList all possible outcomes when flipping two unfair coins.\nAre the coin tosses independent of one another? Why?\nComplete the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(P(HH)\\)\n\\(P(HT)\\)\n\\(P(TH)\\)\n\\(P(TT)\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nProbability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(X =\\) number of coins that land on heads out of two tosses, complete the following probability distribution table.\n\n\n\n\n\\(X\\)\n0\n1\n2\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(P(X)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. There are 4 distinct outcomes you can get from flipping 2 coins. \\[\n  \\{ HH, HT, TH, HH \\}\n\\] b. The coin tosses are independent of each other, because the outcome of a toss does not depend on the outcome of the previous toss. c. We need to first calculate the following probabilities. Assuming that the coin tosses are independent events. Then \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  P(HH) &= P(H) \\cdot P(H) = 0.8 \\cdot 0.8 = 0.64\\\\\n  P(HT) &= P(H) \\cdot P(T) = 0.8 \\cdot 0.2 = 0.16\\\\\n  P(TH) &= P(T) \\cdot P(H) = 0.2 \\cdot 0.8 = 0.16\\\\\n  P(TT) &= P(T) \\cdot P(T) = 0.2 \\cdot 0.2 = 0.04\n\\end{align}\n\\] Finally, adding these probability together, we have \\[\n  P(HH) + P(HT) + P(TH) + P(TT) = 0.64 + 0.16 + 0.16 + 0.04 = 1\n\\] d. First observe that \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  X &= \\text{event with 0 heads} = \\{ TT \\}\\\\,\n  X &= \\text{event with 1 heads} = \\{ HT, TH \\},\\\\\n  X &= \\text{event with 2 heads} = \\{ HH \\}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Therefore \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  P(X = 0) = 0.04,\\\\\n  P(X = 1) = P(HT) + P(TH) = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32,\\\\\n  P(X = 2) = P(HH) = 0.64\n\\end{align}\n\\] And the sum is \\[\n  P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 0.04 + 0.32 + 0.64 = 1.\n\\]"
