Let \\(H\\) to mean heads and \\(T\\) tails.\n\nList all possible outcomes when flipping two unfair coins.\nAre the coin tosses independent of one another?

Assuming that the coin tosses are independent events. Then \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  P(HH) &= P(H) \\cdot P(H) = 0.8 \\cdot 0.8 = 0.64\\\\\n  P(HT) &= P(H) \\cdot P(T) = 0.8 \\cdot 0.2 = 0.16\\\\\n  P(TH) &= P(T) \\cdot P(H) = 0.2 \\cdot 0.8 = 0.16\\\\\n  P(TT) &= P(T) \\cdot P(T) = 0.2 \\cdot 0.2 = 0.04\n\\end{align}\n\\] Finally, adding these probability together, we have \\[\n  P(HH) + P(HT) + P(TH) + P(TT) = 0.64 + 0.16 + 0.16 + 0.04 = 1\n\\]\nFirst observe that \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  X &= \\text{event with 0 heads} = \\{ TT \\},\\\\\n  X &= \\text{event with 1 heads} = \\{ HT, TH \\},\\\\\n  X &= \\text{event with 2 heads} = \\{ HH \\}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Therefore \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  P(X = 0) &= 0.04,\\\\\n  P(X = 1) &= P(HT) + P(TH) = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32,\\\\\n  P(X = 2) &= P(HH) = 0.64\n\\end{align}\n\\] And the sum is \\[\n  P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 0.04 + 0.32 + 0.64 = 1.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 3\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nThis probability density curve shows the probability of wait times before service at a coffee shop.

The maximum wait time is 5 minutes. c. The probability that someone will wait between 0 and 2 minutes is somewhat less than 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 4\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nA bus arrives at a certain stop every 12 minutes. The graph below shows the probability distribution for the continuous random variable \\(X =\\) wait time before the bus arrives. This is an example of a uniform distribution, that is, a distribution in which every possibility for the random variable \\(X\\) is equally likely. Use this distribution to find the probability of a wait time between 4 and 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the probability of waiting between 4 and 10 minutes, we simply find the area of of the rectangle that is between 4 and 10. The width of the red rectangle is \\(10 - 4 = 6\\) and its height is \\(0.0833\\), so \\[\n  P(4 \\leqslant X \\leqslant 10) = 6 \\times 0.0833 = 0.4998 \\approx 0.5\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 5\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nSuppose an instructor designs lessons so that the class lengths are uniformly distributed between 72.0 and 77.0 minutes. That is, any time between 72.0 min and 77.0 min is possible and all the possible values are equally likely. If we let \\(X\\) be the random variable representing the length of that class, then the random variable \\(X\\) has a distribution that can be graphed below.\n\nIs the length of the class a continuous or a discrete random variable?\nCan a probability distribution (a table) be created for this random variable?\nThe probability density function for the random variable of class time is given below. What is the total area under the curve?\nDetermine the probability that the class runs over 75.5 minutes, i.e., \\(P(X \\geqslant 75.5)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe length of class time is a continuous variable.\nSince the variable is continuous, a probability distribution table cannot be created.\nThe total area under the curve is the total area of the entire rectangle: \\[\n  \\text{area} = (77 - 72) \\times 0.2 = 5 \\times 0.2 = 1\n\\]\nThe probability \\(P(X \\geqslant 75)\\) is the area of the shaded region that is between 75 and 77: \\[\n  P(X \\geqslant 75.5) = (77 - 75.5) \\times 0.2 = 1.5 \\times 0.2 = 0.3\n\\]"
