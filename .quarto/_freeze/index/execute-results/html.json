These graphs have an [**area**]{style='color:red'} under the curve that must equal to 1. Therefore, **the area under the curve represents the probability.**\n:::\n\n## Section 6.1 Examples\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance='default' icon=\"false\"}\n# Example 1\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n# Question\n\nConsider the random variable $X$ where $X =$ number of stars given by a randomly selected book reviewer.
