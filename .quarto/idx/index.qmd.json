That is, any time between 72.0 min and 77.0 min is possible and all the possible values are equally likely. If we let $X$ be the random variable representing the length of that class, then the random variable $X$ has a distribution that can be graphed below.\n\na. Is the length of the class a continuous or a discrete random variable?\nb. Can a probability distribution (a table) be created for this random variable?\nc. The probability density function for the random variable of class time is given below. What is the total area under the curve?\nd. Determine the probability that the class runs over 75.5 minutes, i.e., $P(X \\geqslant 75.5)$.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\ndf_ex_65 <- data.frame(\n  x = c(72, 72, 77, 77),\n  y = c(0, 0.2, 0.2, 0)\n)\n\nggplot(df_ex_65, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_polygon(fill = NA, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Minutes\", y = \"Density\") +\n  xlim(71.5, 77.5) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(0, 0.22),\n    breaks = c(0, 0.2),\n    labels = c(\"\", \"0.2\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n# Answer\n\n[a.
